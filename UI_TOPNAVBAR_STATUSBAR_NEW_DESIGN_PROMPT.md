# UI Top Navigation Bar & Status Bar Design Prompt

@agent-ui-design-architect design a new TopNavigationBar with left the logo, a region(connection) with connection options:

- connect wallet
- RPC (with edit option). In the middle a region(navigation region) with the navigation
buttons (Dashboard, swapper, flywheel). right a region(toggle region) with the two toggle-buttons (one for DARK/LIGHT
and one for animation ON/OFF). A second bar always visible on top of the page is the statusBar: in this bar there will
 be info and status indicators and buttons to make quick adjustments about the dashboard, swapper(mode select,
progress information,fee vault) and flywheel information. This statusbar has to be sleek and compact to give the user
the right information about his application. Design in modern pond0matic style so buttons can change colors and style
by the choice of the user (for example by changing the dashboard or by choosing a swap mode.) You can delete old
Navigation or statusbar layout.

@agent-comprehensive-code-reviewer after completion review the code, give enhancements and write a short manual of how to use this top-notch navigation.
